This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### Project Description

This will list the most starred Github repos that were created in the last 30 days (30 results per time).

### Dependencies

`redux` : Used to manage this application state.

`redux-saga` : Used to manage asynchronous request(such as data fetching in this project) easier to manage , and for better handling errors.

`reduxDevTools`: Used for debugging application's state changes(You should have Redux DevTools extension to work with this feature).

`enzyme`: Make easier to test components in react, this will help in this project for snapshot testing.

`Jest` : For testing.

### Features

`Scroll` : When you reach the bottom of the page a new set of data (30 results will be added), the api may fail after several fetching due the the limit that github placed.

`Loader` : A loader must appear in the top right in the header when you reach the bottom of scroll, this mean that that the HTTP client is fetching a new result from github api.

`error boudary` : This feature render an error component if there is an error in the code.
